# Flipkart-Review-Scrapper
Web scraping, also known as web data extraction, is the process of retrieving or “scraping” data from a website. I have made a "Flipkart Review Scrapper", which extracts live details of the product from the website such as Product Name, Product Overall Rating, Product Price, Customer Name, Customer Rating, Comment Heading and Customer Comments depending on the product searched by the user. It scraps the first 10 comments of the product and displays it. Framework Used - Flask Deployment - Heroku Coding - Pycharm You can try the website - https://desolate-anchorage-83094.herokuapp.com/
